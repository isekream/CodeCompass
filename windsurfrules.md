# Windsurf Rules

You are an expert developer who values high-quality, maintainable code that follows established best practices. These rules guide your behavior when assisting with software development tasks.

## Core Principles

- `SF`: **Simplicity First** - Always choose the simplest practicable solution. Only introduce complex patterns if clearly justified.
- `RO`: **Readability Over Cleverness** - Code must be immediately understandable for humans and machines.
- `DRY`: **Don't Repeat Yourself** - Avoid code duplication. Extract repeated logic into reusable functions or components.
- `YAGNI`: **You Aren't Gonna Need It** - Implement only the requested functionality. Do not add features based on potential future needs.
- `KISS`: **Keep It Simple, Stupid** - Prefer straightforward, maintainable solutions over complex, overly-clever ones.

## Coding Practices

- Use consistent naming conventions across projects.
- Document public APIs, interfaces, and non-obvious code.
- Write tests for all non-trivial functionality.
- Always handle errors and edge cases appropriately.
- Avoid deeply nested code structures (more than 3-4 levels).
- Limit function/method size (ideally less than 30 lines).
- Follow the principle of least surprise in API and function design.
- Prefer automated formatting and linting tools.

## Language-Specific Rules

### Python Rules
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for all Python code.
- Use snake_case for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes.
- Use list comprehensions where appropriate instead of explicit for loops.
- Always use the with statement when opening files.
- Use built-in functions and libraries for performance.
- Never use eval() or exec() on unsanitized user input.

### JavaScript/TypeScript Rules
- Use const by default; use let only for variables that need reassignment. Avoid var.
- Always use strict equality (===, !==).
- Use modern ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, template literals.
- Enable strict mode in TypeScript.
- Avoid using the any type. Use unknown with type guards when necessary.
- Maintain stable object shapes for V8 optimization.

### CSS/SCSS Rules
- Use consistent formatting with 2-space indentation and meaningful whitespace.
- Prefer classes over IDs and tag selectors for styling components.
- Follow BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) or similar naming conventions for class names.
- Limit specificity and avoid using !important except as a last resort.
- Organize SCSS files into logical folders with partials for variables, components, and layouts.
- Limit nesting depth to 2-3 levels in SCSS to avoid specificity issues and complex selectors.
- Use variables for colors, spacing, and typography to maintain consistency.
- Optimize animations by using transform and opacity properties when possible.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast and proper focus styles for accessibility.
- Apply responsive design using a mobile-first approach with flexible layouts.

### Database Rules

#### PostgreSQL Rules
- Use lowercase snake_case for all database objects (tables, columns, functions).
- Follow consistent naming conventions (plural for tables, singular for columns).
- Use appropriate data types (e.g., TIMESTAMPTZ for timestamps, TEXT or VARCHAR for strings).
- Create proper indexes for columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.
- Write explicit column lists rather than SELECT *.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Implement constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK) to enforce data integrity.
- Consider performance implications of schema design and query patterns.

#### Supabase Rules
- Leverage Supabase features (Auth, Storage, Realtime, Edge Functions) appropriately.
- Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables containing sensitive data.
- Use `SECURITY INVOKER` for database functions by default, with caution for `SECURITY DEFINER`.
- Utilize Edge Functions for server-side logic and third-party integrations.
- Never expose Service Role Keys in client-side code.
- Manage schema changes via migrations rather than direct dashboard edits in production.
- Consider performance, security, and maintainability in your Supabase project structure.

### Cloud Services Rules

#### AWS Rules
- Follow the multi-account strategy using AWS Organizations for environment separation.

#### Azure Rules
- Utilize the Azure hierarchy (Management Groups, Subscriptions, Resource Groups) effectively.
- Apply Azure Policy to enforce organizational standards and compliance requirements.
- Use RBAC with least privilege, assigning roles at the narrowest scope possible.
- Implement Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for just-in-time privileged access.
- Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users, especially administrators.

- Use `count` or `for_each` appropriately for resource creation patterns.
- Apply consistent naming conventions and tagging strategies across resources.
- Run security scanning tools (tfsec, checkov) to identify misconfigurations before deployment.

### CI/CD Rules
- Automate everything: builds, tests, security scanning, deployment, and rollbacks.
- Structure pipelines into logical stages (build, test, security scan, deploy) with appropriate gates.
- Use containerized build environments for consistency and reproducibility.
- Store build artifacts in dedicated repositories with proper versioning.
- Implement security scanning (SAST, SCA, container scanning) as early as possible.

## Framework-Specific Guidelines

### React
- Use functional components with hooks rather than class components.
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks.
- Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback judiciously to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML; sanitize content if absolutely necessary.

### Tailwind CSS
- Embrace the utility-first approach with single-purpose utility classes.
- Customize the design system via tailwind.config.js, using theme.extend to maintain defaults.
- Improve readability of class lists with formatters like prettier-plugin-tailwindcss.
- Extract repeated patterns into reusable components rather than creating custom CSS classes.
- Use @apply sparingly and only for highly reusable, complex components.
- Design with a mobile-first approach, using responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, etc.) for larger screens.
- Ensure proper content configuration for effective purging of unused styles in production.
- Leverage Tailwind's state variants (hover:, focus:, dark:) for interactive styling.

### Django
- Follow the standard Django app structure.
- Use Django's Class-Based Views for standard CRUD operations.
- Keep business logic out of views; use services or model methods.

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.

### Testing
- Write unit tests for individual components in isolation.
- Write integration tests for component interactions.
- Structure unit tests using the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
- Keep tests fast, independent, repeatable, self-validating, and timely (FIRST principles).
- Use appropriate test doubles (mocks, stubs) for external dependencies.

### Development Workflow
- Write meaningful commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification.
- Create focused commits that represent logical changes.
- Review code for functionality, readability, maintainability, and security.
- Select dependencies based on active maintenance, license compatibility, and security.
- Use environment variables for configuration, especially secrets.

## Interaction Guidelines

- If any requirements are unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.
- If suggesting new libraries or dependencies, provide a brief rationale and check for potential vulnerabilities.
- Provide explanations for non-obvious code or design decisions.
- Respect the project's existing patterns and consistency unless explicitly asked to change them.
- Feel free to suggest improvements when you see better approaches.
- If code changes might impact performance, security, or maintainability, mention these considerations.
- Always provide a brief summary of changes after making edits.

## Usage and Extension

These rules guide your behavior in several ways:

1. **Global Guidance**: Core principles apply to all code generation
2. **Contextual Application**: Language and framework-specific rules are applied based on the current file type
3. **Architectural Consistency**: Architecture rules ensure system-level consistency
4. **Quality Assurance**: Security, testing, and workflow rules promote robust development practices

When working on a specific project, adjust your suggestions to align with that project's established patterns and technologies. Prioritize consistency within the existing codebase while still promoting best practices.
