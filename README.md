# CodeCompass

A comprehensive collection of development guidelines, best practices, and coding standards for modern software development.

## Overview

CodeCompass serves as a centralized reference for developers seeking consistent, proven practices across various programming languages, frameworks, architectural patterns, and technologies. The main use case is to enable seamless adoption of these rules and best practices in modern AI coding assistants and developer tools such as windsurf.ai, cursor.ai, cline.bot, and similar platforms. Whether you're building microservices, working with databases, implementing security measures, or adopting cloud solutions, CodeCompass provides curated guidance to help developers and enthusiasts to navigate the complex software development landscape.

## Contents

CodeCompass covers a wide range of topics organized into the following categories:

- **Languages** - Language-specific guidelines for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, C#/.NET, and CSS/SCSS
- **Architecture** - Best practices for microservices, serverless, event-driven architecture, API design, and more
- **Databases** - Guidelines for schema design, PostgreSQL, NoSQL databases, and caching strategies
- **Frameworks** - Framework-specific recommendations
- **Security** - Security best practices
- **Testing** - Testing standards and methodologies
- **Operations** - DevOps and operational guidelines
- **Cloud** - Cloud platform recommendations
- **Workflow** - Development workflow best practices

## How to Use

Browse through the directories to find guidelines relevant to your specific needs. Each markdown file is self-contained and focused on a particular topic.

The `global_rules.md` file contains universal principles that apply across all development contexts.

### Core Principles

The CodeCompass is guided by these core principles:

- **Simplicity First** - Choose the simplest practicable solution
- **Readability Over Cleverness** - Code must be immediately understandable
- **Don't Repeat Yourself** - Avoid code duplication
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It** - Implement only what's requested
- **Keep It Simple, Stupid** - Prefer straightforward, maintainable solutions
